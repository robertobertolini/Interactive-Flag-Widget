# Python-Interactive-Flag-Widget

This project was done in collaboration with Tiffany Roberti for a graduate course in scientific computing (AMS 595) at Stony Brook University during the fall 2017 semester. 

Our project creates an interactive educational interface using the Tkinter and Turtle Graphics packages in
Python to draw the flags of different countries. By clicking on features and colors of the flag,
students can learn about the symbolic meanings of their shapes and colors in real time,
supplementing their learning in a classroom setting.
